# Supabase Functions for Supatrack

There are 3 functions 

## Setup

You need Deno https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/

When the entire project is opened in Cusror/VsCode, the Deno imports have red squiggles but seem to work.

## Running dev functions locally

```
./start.sh
```

And us the varioius `debug_*.ts` functions to call the routes locally.

There is not localy database setup so the db side effects can't be tested locally.
